## Mathematical Olympiad

My favourite thing in the world in Euclidean geometry so 
I will dedicate it this section.

I wrote my own handout on Lemmas in Olympiad geometry:


**[Book of Lemmas](/olympiad/book_2.pdf)** 
<br>*Collection of important geometry configurations and beautiful problems*
*   *Includes many great diagrams like the one to the rigth*
<!-- *   *Includes problems on non-inertial frames.*
*   *Detailed solutions are provided.* -->

If you want to learn how to make diagrams like that I recommend:

### Asymptote
* [Asymptote: The Vector Graphics Language](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/index.html)
* [Asymptote Guide](https://web.evanchen.cc/asyguide.html)

### Latex 
For general Latex advice you might like to check out:

* [Evan's LaTeX Style Guide](https://web.evanchen.cc/latex-style-guide.html)

I personally also like those templates Evan's [link] and Kevin's [link].
