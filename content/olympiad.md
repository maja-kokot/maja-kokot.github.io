## Mathematical Olympiad

I wrote my own handout on Lemmas in Olympiad geometry:

<!-- <strong><a href="/olympiad/book_2.pdf" onclick="gtag('event', 'pdf_download', {'pdf_url': this.href});" target="_blank">Book of Lemmas</a></strong> -->


**Book of Lemmas** [[comming soon]]() 
<br>*A collection of important geometric configurations, advanced lemmas, and beautiful problems, complete with original diagrams created in Asymptote.*
*  *Collection of important geometry configurations and beautiful problems*
*   *Includes many great diagrams like the one to the rigth*
<!-- *   *Includes problems on non-inertial frames.*
*   *Detailed solutions are provided.* -->

If you want to learn how to make diagrams like that I recommend:

### Asymptote
* [Asymptote: The Vector Graphics Language](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/index.html)
* [Asymptote Guide](https://web.evanchen.cc/asyguide.html)

### Latex 
For general LaTeX advice you might like to check out:

* [Evan's LaTeX Style Guide](https://web.evanchen.cc/latex-style-guide.html)

I personally also like those templates Evan's [link] and Kevin's [link].

Other great LaTeX resources:

* **[⟨q|pic⟩: Quantum circuits](https://github.com/qpic/qpic)** 
<br>*drawing complex quantum circuits*

My passion for mathematics and particularly geometry was forged through years of training for and competing in national and international Olympiads. 
This is where I learned to break down complex problems with elegant structures.

## Physics Olympiad

If you would like to get started with Physics Olympiad 
I recomend:

* **[The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)**
<br>*Great for seeing the beutiful ideas behind physics*

* **Physics, Volume 1 and 2 5th Edition by Robert Resnick, David Halliday, Kenneth S. Krane**
<br>*Book from which I studied for the Olympiad*


* **[Kevin Zhou's Physics Olympiad Handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#physics-olympiad-handouts)** 
<br>*Collection of handouts 
covering great introductions and problems 
from various olympiad topics.*
<!-- *   *Covers Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.*
*   *Includes problems on non-inertial frames.*
*   *Detailed solutions are provided.* -->
