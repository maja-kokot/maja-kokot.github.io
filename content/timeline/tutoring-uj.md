Selected for an individual tutoring at the Faculty of Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science of the Jagiellonian University. My supervisior was Professor *Łukasz Kosiński* and we covered coursework on *complex analysis* and *elliptic curves*.

"Since the 2017/18 academic year, the Faculty has been mentoring the most mathematically gifted high school students, primarily from southern Poland, by assigning them tutors who will help them develop their overall mathematical skills. Tutoring is based on individual meetings and remote contact. 

Tutoring is aimed at students with the highest mathematical potential, documented by outstanding achievements, for whom traditional interest groups and Olympic workshops are no longer sufficient."
