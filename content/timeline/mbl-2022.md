"**Maths Beyond Limits** is a Europe-wide camp for high school students interested in maths.
The aim of the project is to create space for development of young maths enthusiasts through
working on interesting and demanding mathematical subjects. It is designed to encourage participants to share their knowledge and passion with others as well as to enhance cooperation and
integration of European mathematical societies. Moreover, its goal is to awaken youthâ€™s curiosity
and to help them make important habits of creative thinking, self-development, ambition and
ability to cooperate."

I particularly enjoyed classes on *Lambda Calculus* and *Projective geometry*.
Outside of academics, I also had a chance to participate in many fun activities, such as *Waltz Sessions* - and learn how to waltz!
