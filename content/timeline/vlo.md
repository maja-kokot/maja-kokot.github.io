Started attending the algorithmic class under the auspices of Jagiellonian University's Institutes of both Mathematics and Computer Science of the Vth High School in Cracow, which is consistenstly ranked in top 3 high schools in Poland. Class profile I chose allowed me to cover two additional subjects not included in the school curriculum - Mathematical Faculty and Algorithmics. During algorithmics I was able to master my C++ programming skills and solve competitive programming problems, while in the mathematical faculty I covered the four core fields of Olympiad mathematics. I was also taken under the individual course of studying sheme for Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science which allowed me to follow my passions and go beyond the taught material.
